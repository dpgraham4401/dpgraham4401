# Reads Worth Their Weight When Moving

This list doesn't encompass everything I've read, mostly just things I've read to pick up new skills and my
recommendations.

It has two sections:

- [The Good Stuff](#the-good-stuff)
- [Save Your Money](#save-your-money)

There's a gray area between the two list, things I wouldn't actively recommend but didn't strongly dislike either. I
don't bother including those.

## The Good Stuff

Stuff I recommend divided by category.

- [Design and Concepts](#design-and-concepts)
- [Technical Skills](#technical-skills)
- [Fun](#fun)

### Design and Concepts

Books that talk about abstract concepts, system design, and idea worms that'll have you thinking differently.

- [x] [The Cathedral and the Bazaar (Raymond)](https://www.amazon.com/Cathedral-Bazaar-Musings-Accidental-Revolutionary-ebook/dp/B0026OR3LM/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+cathedral+and+the+bazaar&qid=1651241395&s=books&sprefix=The+cathedral+an%2Cstripbooks%2C62&sr=1-1)

    - The classic scoop on why open-source is kick-butt.

- [x] [Clean Code (Martin)](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)

    - I continue to revisit this book, and it continues to give me those _aHa!_ moments.

- [x] [The Clean Coder](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10284614-the-clean-coder)

    - Not as much of a page turner as Clean Code and Clean Architecture but glad I listened to it. It was good as an
      audiobook.

- [x] [Clean Agile](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45280021-clean-agile)

    - Listening as audiobook. Seems more like a memoir. I honestly did not absorb this well.

    - Just read in piecemeal. Reread as an audiobook, good the second go around.

- [x] [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (Gamma et al.)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85009.Design_Patterns)

    - Not a particularly fun book IMO, and a little old, but still applicable.

- [x] [Designing Data-Intensive Applications (Kleppmann)](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable-ebook/dp/B06XPJML5D)

    - This is a slow read.

- [x] [Principles of Web Design](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58437874-principles-of-web-design)

- [x] [Monolith to Microservices: Evolutionary Patterns to Transform Your Monolith](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44144499-monolith-to-microservices)

- [x] [Building Microservices: Designing Fine-Grained Systems](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22512931-building-microservices)
    - I actually come back to this book as a reference, I don't even write microservices

### Technical Skills

These were books I read to pick up a new skill.

- [x] [Pro Git (Chacon & Straub)](https://www.amazon.com/Pro-Git-Scott-Chacon-ebook/dp/B01ISNIKES/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1O11N3VF3K50M&keywords=Pro+Git&qid=1660390419&sprefix=pro+git%2Caps%2C69&sr=8-1)

    - Good (free) comprehensive guide everyone who uses Git should read.

- [x] [The Kubernetes Book - 2022 edition (Nigel Poulton)](https://www.amazon.com/Kubernetes-Book-Version-November-2018-ebook/dp/B072TS9ZQZ/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=the+kubernetes+book+2022+edition&qid=1660389961&sprefix=the+kuber%2Caps%2C54&sr=8-3)

    - Great, up-to-date, core concepts of K8. Good as an ebook.

    - Well written coverage of how Docker works under the hood, not a full API/CLI reference but really takes Docker
      from the abstract to the concrete. Cheap, and gets updates frequently. Good as e-book.

- [ ] [The C Programming Language (Kernigan and Ritchie)](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+c+programming+language&qid=1651783300&s=books&sprefix=The+C+programm%2Cstripbooks%2C68&sr=1-1)

    - If Kernighan wrote _The C programming Language_ like this, I see why it's a classic. Fantastic explainations.

- [x] [Unit Testing: Principles, Practices and Patterns (Khorikov)](https://www.amazon.com/Unit-Testing-Principles-Practices-Patterns/dp/1617296279)

    - I really apprecaited the section on identifying what makes a quality unit test and doesn't just push the idea that
      you should have 100% code coverage.

- [x] [Cloud Native Go](https://www.amazon.com/Cloud-Native-Go-Unreliable-Environments/dp/1492076333)

    - Great intuitive bits on unique(ish) parts of Go like interfaces and goroutines with a primer on different types of
      cloud computing

- [x] [The Rust Book](https://www.amazon.com/Rust-Programming-Language-Covers-2018-ebook/dp/B07SRQ97RD/ref=sr_1_5?crid=7GBV2VCB7YZU&keywords=the+rust+book&qid=1664799604&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIwLjQwIiwicXNhIjoiMC4zMiIsInFzcCI6IjAuNTIifQ%3D%3D&s=digital-text&sprefix=the+rust+book%2Cdigital-text%2C70&sr=1-5)

    - The self-proclaimed classic intro. Good as an ebook. Will make any programmer think.

    - This was a great intro to web dev with Go's, but I wish it dealt with more advanced topics.

- [x] [Learning PHP, MySQL & JavaScript](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-MySQL-JavaScript-Step-Step/dp/1492093823/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=learning+php%2C+mysql+%26+javascript&qid=1654520437&s=books&sprefix=Learning+PHP%2Cstripbooks%2C69&sr=1-1)

    - This one is on here for sentimental reasons, one of my first hands-on introductions to web development.

- [x] [The Unix and Linux System Administration Handbook (Nemeth +)](https://www.amazon.com/UNIX-Linux-System-Administration-Handbook/dp/0134277554/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=unix+and+linux+system+administration+handbook&qid=1651783202&s=books&sprefix=The+unix+and+lin%2Cstripbooks%2C67&sr=1-1)

    - A classic reference to have on hand.

    - Good as an all around reference for the language

- [x] [Object-Oriented Python: Master OOP by Building Games and GUIs (Kalb) ](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=object+oriented+programming+python&i=digital-text&sprefix=object+orient%2Cdigital-text%2C65&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_2_13)

    - A great intro to OOP for pythonistas. Made me appreciate interfaces in Golang much more. I skipped the gui/game
      making sections.

- [x] [Rust for Rustaceans (Gjengset)](https://www.amazon.com/Rust-Rustaceans-Programming-Experienced-Developers/dp/1718501854/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=rust+for+rustaceans&qid=1664802037&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIwLjc0IiwicXNhIjoiMC40MiIsInFzcCI6IjAuNTAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=rust+for+ru%2Caps%2C86&sr=8-1)

    - This is a questionable inclusion, the section on the DOM was a little lacking.

    - Seems a little long, it meanders into thing it should just assume the reader knows, but I like the writing style
      so far.

- [x] [Web Security for Developers: Real Threats, Practical Defense](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51787793-think-javahttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54104272-web-security-for-developers)
    - A short, but practical primer. I enjoyed it because it's a level deeper than common documentation goes

### Fun

Fun stuff I just couldn't leave off the list.

- [x] [Team of Rivals - Unabridged (Goodwin)](https://www.amazon.com/Team-of-Rivals-audiobook/dp/B00518Z5DS/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1Z8ZZ27BDBRQ3&keywords=team+of+rivals&qid=1653395532&s=books&sprefix=team+of+rivals%2Cstripbooks%2C64&sr=1-1)

    - Good as Audiobook

- [x] [The Wright Brothers (David McCullough)](https://www.amazon.com/The-Wright-Brothers-audiobook/dp/B00TA5MPEU/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+wright+brothers+david+mccullough&qid=1654520736&s=books&sprefix=the+wright+brothers%2Cstripbooks%2C68&sr=1-1)

- [x] [Storm of Steel (Ernst Jünger)](https://www.amazon.com/Storm-Steel-New-Translation-American-English-ebook/dp/B074YTLTXN/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=storm+of+steel&qid=1660390064&sprefix=Storm+of+s%2Caps%2C63&sr=8-2)

- [x] [How the Internet Happened (Brian McCullough)](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/38212134)

    - enjoyable romp through recent history.

- [x] [The Phoenix Project (Kim, Behr, & Spafford)](https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/0988262592)

    - Oddly entertaining narative on why devops is beneficial. Would **only** do as an Audiobook.

- [x] [The Lord of the Rings (J. R. R. Tolkien)](https://www.amazon.com/Lord-Rings-One-J-R-R-Tolkien-ebook/dp/B007978OY6/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+lord+of+the+rings&qid=1660388666&s=digital-text&sprefix=the+lord%2Cdigital-text%2C64&sr=1-1)

- [x] [The Hobbit (J. R. R. Tolkien)](https://www.amazon.com/Hobbit-Lord-Rings-J-R-R-Tolkien-ebook/dp/B0079KT81G/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=the+lord+of+the+rings&qid=1660388666&s=digital-text&sprefix=the+lord%2Cdigital-text%2C64&sr=1-3)

- [ ] [A short History of Everything](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21.A_Short_History_of_Nearly_Everything)

- [ ] [The Guns of August (Tuchman and Massie)](https://www.amazon.com/Guns-August-Pulitzer-Prize-Winning-Outbreak/dp/0345476093)

## Save your money

This is books I usually felt that I could have done without, or maybe there was a better place to find the information.

- Most books published by Packt. Their price tags and title are usually enticing but I've yet to read one that I thought
  either didn't deliver on content or there was a better alternative.

- [ ] [Python for Devops (Gift et al.)](https://www.amazon.com/Python-DevOps-Ruthlessly-Effective-Automation-ebook/dp/B082P97LDW/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2HPQKFN8R1T64&keywords=python+for+devops&qid=1664799859&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIxLjMyIiwicXNhIjoiMC43NSIsInFzcCI6IjAuNDcifQ%3D%3D&s=digital-text&sprefix=python+for+devops%2Cdigital-text%2C63&sr=1-1)

    - Couldn't even finish, just ramblings with little useful info on using python for devops or automation that can't
      be found in a python 101 book.
    - Alternative: unknown

- [x] [Learning React (Banks and Porcello)](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-React-Modern-Patterns-Developing-ebook/dp/B08B489X8Q/ref=sr_1_1?crid=NMF3RZKIIWEU&keywords=Learning+react&qid=1664800003&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIyLjU4IiwicXNhIjoiMi4wMCIsInFzcCI6IjIuMjgifQ%3D%3D&s=digital-text&sprefix=learning+react%2Cdigital-text%2C58&sr=1-1)

    - Plenty of technical mistakes, they must not have run the code they put in the book.
    - Alternative: The React team is putting together more up-to-date docs on using functional components.

- [x] [Docker for Developers (Bullington-McGuire et al)](https://www.amazon.com/Docker-Developers-application-containers-continuous/dp/1789536057/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=docker+for+developers&qid=1664803100&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIxLjU2IiwicXNhIjoiMC45MSIsInFzcCI6IjAuOTgifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=docker+for+%2Caps%2C76&sr=8-1)

    - Not bad necessarily, but not worth the dosh. I wish I had just went with Docker Deep Dive initially.
    - Alternative: see Docker Deep Dive by Poulton.

- [x] [Wicked Cool Shell Scripts (Taylor)](https://www.amazon.com/Wicked-Cool-Shell-Scripts-2nd/dp/1593276028)

    - I have mixed feelings about this one; the shell scripts may be cool, but that doesn't mean they're useful.

- [x] [Node.js Cookbook (Griggs)](https://www.amazon.com/Node-Cookbook-techniques-server-side-development-ebook/dp/B08KTPD498/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1Q3YDCHYBGC53&keywords=node.js+cookbook&qid=1667305628&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIwLjAwIiwicXNhIjoiMC4wMCIsInFzcCI6IjAuMDAifQ%3D%3D&s=books&sprefix=node.js+cookbook%2Cstripbooks%2C56&sr=1-3)

    - Again, like most books to come out of Packt publishing, it's not bad but offers little material that you couldn't
      just pick up online the documentation.

- [x] [Think Java: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51787793-think-java)

    - I only take issue with the title, which should be "basics of programming with java". Not bad if that's what you're
      looking for.

- [x] [CPython Internals: Your Guide to the Python 3 Interpreter](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53412684-cpython-internals)
    - I wanted this to be less abstract. It's enough for someone more curious, but I wanted more.
