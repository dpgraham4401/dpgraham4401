## The Details

Django Guardian is an open-source python package that extends Django's built-in authentication
backend to allow per-object permissions for the Django framework.
It is widely used in projects requiring robust and flexible permission systems.

As an open-source maintainer for Django Guardian, I contribute to the ongoing development and
maintenance of the project. My responsibilities include reviewing pull requests, addressing issues
reported by the community, and ensuring the library remains compatible with the latest versions of
Django.

## The Features

- Open-source maintenance
- Authentication, authorization, and security risk management
- Compatible with the latest Django versions
- Python packaging
- Documentation and user support
