# Reads Worth Their Weight When Moving

This list doesn't encompass everything I've read, mostly just things I've read to pick up new skills
and my
recommendations.

It has two sections:

- [The Good Stuff](#the-good-stuff)
- [Save Your Money](#save-your-money)

There's a gray area between the two list, things I wouldn't actively recommend but didn't strongly
dislike either. I
don't bother including those.

## The Good Stuff

Stuff I recommend divided by category.

- [Design and Concepts](#design-and-concepts)
- [Technical Skills](#technical-skills)
- [Fun](#fun)

### Design and Concepts

Books that talk about abstract concepts, system design, and idea worms that'll have you thinking
differently.

- [x] [The Cathedral and the Bazaar (Raymond)](https://www.amazon.com/Cathedral-Bazaar-Musings-Accidental-Revolutionary-ebook/dp/B0026OR3LM/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+cathedral+and+the+bazaar&qid=1651241395&s=books&sprefix=The+cathedral+an%2Cstripbooks%2C62&sr=1-1)
  - The classic scoop on why open-source is kick-butt.

- [x] The Clean Code Series
  - These get a lot of flack for being too dogmatic, but I still consider them required reading.
    The best advice I heard was, read and ingest the ideas, then "let them go."
  - [x] [Clean Code (Martin)](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)
  - [x] [Clean Architecture (Martin)](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Architecture-Craftsmans-Software-Structure/dp/0134494164/ref=pd_bxgy_img_sccl_1/132-7763395-0841352?pd_rd_w=kosNV&pf_rd_p=6b3eefea-7b16-43e9-bc45-2e332cbf99da&pf_rd_r=ES82JM82CTAYB524G4NT&pd_rd_r=b6173348-8ff7-4339-a387-8acb159a2d94&pd_rd_wg=nJnV4&pd_rd_i=0134494164&psc=1)
  - [x] [The Clean Coder](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10284614-the-clean-coder)
    - Not a page turner like _Clean Code_ and _Clean Architecture_, but glad I listened to it.
    - Good as an audiobook.
  - [x] [Clean Agile](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45280021-clean-agile)
    - Listening as audiobook. Seems more like a memoir. I honestly did not absorb this well.

- [x] [The Pragmatic Programmer (Thomas and Hunt)](https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-journey-mastery-Anniversary/dp/0135957052/ref=pd_bxgy_img_sccl_2/132-7763395-0841352?pd_rd_w=J7jlp&pf_rd_p=6b3eefea-7b16-43e9-bc45-2e332cbf99da&pf_rd_r=5YMBCJAG6Y6BW4QK46RV&pd_rd_r=f82b12a5-c7c0-4bc9-b45d-87f9118a423e&pd_rd_wg=E7KUG&pd_rd_i=0135957052&psc=1)

- [x] [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (Gamma et al.)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85009.Design_Patterns)
  - Not particularly fun, and a little old, but still the OG source for code design patterns.

- [x] [Designing Data-Intensive Applications (Kleppmann)](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable-ebook/dp/B06XPJML5D)
  - Interesting examination on things like relational databases vs. no-sql DBs, reliability vs.
    access, stream vs. batch.

- [x] [The Twelve Factor App (?)](https://12factor.net/)
  - Not a book, but a must-read one pager.

- [x] [The DevOps Handbook (Allspaw et al.)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26083308-the-devops-handbook?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_10)

- [x] [Infrastructure as Code 2nd edition (Kief Morris)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53481701-infrastructure-as-code)

- [x] [How to Win Friends and influence People](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4865.How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=BDDCIEPZAE&rank=1)

- [x] [Principles of Web Design](<[url](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58437874-principles-of-web-design)>)
  - Great primer on web page design, SEO, and page element.

- [x] [Building Your Storybrand](<[url](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34460583-building-a-storybrand?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=6ttgYnacGU&rank=1)>)

- [x] [Algorithms to Live by](<[url](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25666050-algorithms-to-live-by)>)

- [x] [Principles of Web Design](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58437874-principles-of-web-design)

- [x] [Monolith to Microservices: Evolutionary Patterns to Transform Your Monolith](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44144499-monolith-to-microservices)

- [x] [Building Microservices: Designing Fine-Grained Systems](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22512931-building-microservices)
  - I actually come back to this book as a reference, I don't even write microservices

### Technical Skills

These were books I read to pick up a new skill.

- [x] [Unit Testing: Principles, Practices and Patterns (Khorikov)](https://www.amazon.com/Unit-Testing-Principles-Practices-Patterns/dp/1617296279)
  - I really appreciated the section on identifying what makes a quality unit test and doesn't just
    push the idea that you should have 100% code coverage.

- [x] [Learning TypeScript](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-TypeScript-Josh-Goldberg-ebook/dp/B0B35C211B/ref=sr_1_3?crid=148Z4U6J07WE8&keywords=Typescript&qid=1660389178&s=digital-text&sprefix=typescript%2Cdigital-text%2C57&sr=1-3)

- [x] [Python Concurrency with asyncio (Matthew Fowler)](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Concurrency-asyncio-Matthew-Fowler/dp/1617298662)

  - Well-written coverage of how Docker works under the hood, not a full API/CLI reference but
    really takes Docker
    from the abstract to the concrete. Cheap, and gets updates frequently. Good as e-book.

  - This one is on here for sentimental reasons, one of my first hands-on introductions to web
    development.

- [] [Node.js Design Patterns (Casciaro and Mammino)](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=node.js+design+patterns)
  - In progress, but I like it so far.

  - If Kernighan wrote _The C programming Language_ like this, I see why it's a classic. Fantastic
    explanations.

Fowler)](https://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Kent-Beck/dp/0321146530/ref=sr_1_1?crid=7DW83N004ITH&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.AbeDgnBhKjUWOyGJGqEqm_DREpfxFu3bHu261PnGaEZ795gu4fDcM1ptDv146dnccuFVEzp7S_XvhCc8MfgFyi4B_jjkhU1QOQqG0JlXvmHJ-P0NwKv18ZIAys7vDWliwcU9rPQD2h-NLA7_ufpUBDBg92IIWc3XsjilHtKpoPAWgxPPhF38eR5WNgN-uO16trJL27KswgKc0ZFVo1RY9G20ni9Oe7leRBswawbJJok.R9rE7ZChY2THJ72nsGHAXOaGkf729LKTNqYvlBXFnd0&dib_tag=se&keywords=test+driven+development&qid=1750788425&sprefix=test+driven+development%2Caps%2C92&sr=8-1)
  - Classic! But I personally prefer _Unit Testing: Principles, Practices and Patterns_.

- [x] [Cloud Native Go](https://www.amazon.com/Cloud-Native-Go-Unreliable-Environments/dp/1492076333)
  - Great intuitive bits on unique(ish) parts of Go like interfaces and goroutines with a primer on
    different types of cloud computing

  - Good as an all around reference for the language

- [x] [Object-Oriented Python: Master OOP by Building Games and GUIs (Kalb) ](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=object+oriented+programming+python&i=digital-text&sprefix=object+orient%2Cdigital-text%2C65&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_2_13)
  - A great intro to OOP for pythonistas that helped me.
    Solidified the concept of programming to an interfaces for me.

- [x] [JavaScriptâ€”The Definitive Guide (Flanagan)](https://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Definitive-Most-Used-Programming-Language/dp/1491952024/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=javascript+the+definitive+guide&qid=1651783105&s=books&sprefix=javascript+the+%2Cstripbooks%2C81&sr=1-1)

    the writing style.

  - A short, but practical primer. I enjoyed it because it's a level deeper than common
    documentation goes

### Fun

Fun stuff I just couldn't leave off the list.

- [x] [Team of Rivals - Unabridged (Goodwin)](https://www.amazon.com/Team-of-Rivals-audiobook/dp/B00518Z5DS/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1Z8ZZ27BDBRQ3&keywords=team+of+rivals&qid=1653395532&s=books&sprefix=team+of+rivals%2Cstripbooks%2C64&sr=1-1)

- [x] [How the Internet Happened (Brian McCullough)](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/38212134)

- [x] [The Phoenix Project (Kim, Behr, & Spafford)](https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/0988262592)
  - Oddly entertaining narrative on why devops is beneficial. Would **only** do as an Audiobook.

- [x] [The Lord of the Rings (I, II, and III) (J. R. R. Tolkien)](https://www.amazon.com/Lord-Rings-One-J-R-R-Tolkien-ebook/dp/B007978OY6/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+lord+of+the+rings&qid=1660388666&s=digital-text&sprefix=the+lord%2Cdigital-text%2C64&sr=1-1)

- [x] [The Guns of August (Tuchman and Massie)](https://www.amazon.com/Guns-August-Pulitzer-Prize-Winning-Outbreak/dp/0345476093)
  - Something history buffs will enjoy, not for everyone.

## Save your money

This is books I usually felt that I could have done without, or maybe there was a better place to
find the information.

- Most books published by Packt. Their price tags and title are usually enticing but I've yet to
  read one that I thought
  either didn't deliver on content, or there was a better alternative.

- [ ] [Python for Devops (Gift et al.)](https://www.amazon.com/Python-DevOps-Ruthlessly-Effective-Automation-ebook/dp/B082P97LDW/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2HPQKFN8R1T64&keywords=python+for+devops&qid=1664799859&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIxLjMyIiwicXNhIjoiMC43NSIsInFzcCI6IjAuNDcifQ%3D%3D&s=digital-text&sprefix=python+for+devops%2Cdigital-text%2C63&sr=1-1)
  - Couldn't even finish, just ramblings with little useful info on using python for devops or
    automation that can't be found in a python 101 book.

- [x] [Learning React (Banks and Porcello)](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-React-Modern-Patterns-Developing-ebook/dp/B08B489X8Q/ref=sr_1_1?crid=NMF3RZKIIWEU&keywords=Learning+react&qid=1664800003&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIyLjU4IiwicXNhIjoiMi4wMCIsInFzcCI6IjIuMjgifQ%3D%3D&s=digital-text&sprefix=learning+react%2Cdigital-text%2C58&sr=1-1)
  - Plenty of technical mistakes, they must not have run the code they put in the book,
    and already outdated.

- [x] [Docker for Developers (Bullington-McGuire et al)](https://www.amazon.com/Docker-Developers-application-containers-continuous/dp/1789536057/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=docker+for+developers&qid=1664803100&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIxLjU2IiwicXNhIjoiMC45MSIsInFzcCI6IjAuOTgifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=docker+for+%2Caps%2C76&sr=8-1)
  - Not bad necessarily, but not worth the cash. I wish I had just stuck with _Docker Deep Dive_.

- [x] [Wicked Cool Shell Scripts (Taylor)](https://www.amazon.com/Wicked-Cool-Shell-Scripts-2nd/dp/1593276028)
  - I have mixed feelings about this one; the shell scripts may be cool,
    but that doesn't mean they're useful.

- [x] [Node.js Cookbook (Griggs)](https://www.amazon.com/Node-Cookbook-techniques-server-side-development-ebook/dp/B08KTPD498/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1Q3YDCHYBGC53&keywords=node.js+cookbook&qid=1667305628&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIwLjAwIiwicXNhIjoiMC4wMCIsInFzcCI6IjAuMDAifQ%3D%3D&s=books&sprefix=node.js+cookbook%2Cstripbooks%2C56&sr=1-3)
  - It's not bad but offers little material that you couldn't just pick up from online docs.

- [x] [Think Java: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51787793-think-java)
  - I only take issue with the title, which should be "basics of programming with Java."
    Not bad if that's what you're looking for.

- [x] [CPython Internals: Your Guide to the Python 3 Interpreter](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53412684-cpython-internals)
  - I wanted this to be less abstract. It's enough for someone more curious, but I wanted more.

- [x] [Microservice APIs: Using Python, Flask, FastAPI, OpenAPI and more(Jost Peralta)](https://www.amazon.com/Microservice-APIs-Python-FastAPI-OpenAPI-ebook/dp/B0BRYJ9KH4/ref=sr_1_1?crid=JA6TLQ69GE0M&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.IvW2Bs99tYGTjEqG-wh_burcVTtkt-J2xc3mUx0Z_LdUPhdi46UJYcbaJn6VZPS3kX1qzKDXEd40V_1gAlV1eeLfnfGBpmUgg7lv0yGcHE4JgIsgd7zd1TDkOUMSZuGH30KrPCn6Uh8ZHdFZITMSPWZ-EgjGSRdMZj151QPSAuUwItpeJU723hKlfgxS1AgW5MTZ_SusvsKvZPlZPCRH8E9P0IcKDlsU7l-cdQ8OZgA.7GrDEzODiMieZKxpiPs2DMmsWXECAi7IMqodnl1omP8&dib_tag=se&keywords=microservice+API&qid=1750788122&sprefix=microservice+api+%2Caps%2C75&sr=8-1)
