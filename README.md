## Introduction

Welcome to `dpgraham-client`, my personal website and a project I use for experimentation and learning.
I used to include articles, such as blogs and tutorials, but I didn't have time to maintain them and update them.

1. Clone this repository and cd to repo root:

    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies using a package manager such as npm or yarn:

    ```shell

3. configure the environment variables:

    ```shell
